# Step 1 - Business models

As a coordinator of a humanitarian organization, I would like to register a shelter for helping persons in need.
The shelter maintains the following data: name, address, number of places, owner with name and contact info: email, phone.
The number of places for the shelter needs to be greater than 0.
I would like to filter at a later time the shelters based on the registration date and time. 
 
- Create Shelter class with required properties
- Add a new method Create for the register functionality
- Set the registration date of the shelter
- Return error from the Create method when the number of places is not greater than 0 by using a Result class, which needs to be created
